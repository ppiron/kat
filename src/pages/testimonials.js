          My 5-year-old daughter has been taking lessons from Katya for about 2 years. The lessons are fun and exciting and I am happy with her progress and the patience Katya has in coaching her.

          Katya is a wonderful person, her good sense of humour and flexibility always make lessons enjoyable. Most importantly, she always has the patience to make sure that you are doing everything right, and that she answers any question that you may have.
